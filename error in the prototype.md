1.The player attack was giving an error even if it was working fine.
fix: Altered the code so it gets the enemies health script when colliding instead of when is created/awakened.
2.there were errors with the walking enemy script causing it to not moving towards the player when created and not interacting with the support script.
fix: I made so it looks for the player object by the tag it has, and did a similar thing to the enemy script.
